* Ideas
** Energy weapons. Do they add anything? Do they make things simpler? Do people even like energy weapons?
*** Shared charge between all weapons. Once it runs out, screwed?
Regenerates over time?
* Weapon system
** Weapon list
 - Shotgun
 - Assault rifle
 - Pistol (2 kinds)
 - Semi auto
** Distribution
*** Inital
Give pistols.
Make humans weak at start, strong at end
*** Progression
Options for unlock better guns
- Percentage of infection
- Time
Infection gun effectiveness decreases as gun effectivness increases :)
Possible inital values 0.9 -> 0.3
Still has normal system, so gimpedness is always same.
