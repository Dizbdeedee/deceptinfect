        Allows you to override trace result when a trace hits the entitys Bounding Box. 
		
		
		Name | Description
		--- | ---
		`startpos` | Start position of the trace
		`delta` | Offset from startpos to the endpos of the trace
		`isbox` | Is the trace a hull trace?
		`extents` | Size of the hull trace?
		`mask` | The CONTENTS_ Enums mask
