## Overview

You and your crew are stranded on an abandoned station. One of you is infected with a deadly alien virus, has released it into the air supply, and is planning on the ultimate betrayal of mankind. Can you stop the virus before it consumes your humanity, and your crewmates?

- Time is running out...

The air supply has been contaminated with the virus! There's not a lot of time left. Look to your infection meter to see how long you can last. Bewarned, the infected have tools to make this time shorter.

- Watch out behind you

The infected have tendrils that can whip out and grab you! Avoid exposing your back to people you don't trust.

- Tick tick tick

Some air pockets may be heavily contaminated with the virus. You should listen carefully to your trusty geiger counter to increase your chances of survival.

- The ground is not safe

The virus also spreads in a weaker physical form. Standing on it for too long can make you much more vunerable to attack.

- Use items to make deductions

We need to know who we can trust. Find the items assigned to you and use them to make the best deductions you can on who is trustworthy. You best hope no one has tampered with them...

- Use guns to conclude your arguments

If you're sure you've got one of them, open fire immediately! Thier final alligence will be revealed in due course. Incorrect conclusions may erode the faith your fellow crewmates have in you.

- Bring the AI online

To drive out the infection you must fully power the AI, using batteries. The AI gives us access to our guns and once fully powered, holds the key to driving back the infected for good. Bringing the AI offline would of course be in the best interest of our enemies.

- Nevermind that, get the hell out of here!

If all else fails, we need someone to tell us about the looming threat. Bring the flares to the evacuation pad and we'll nuke the station from orbit. I hope you trust everyone you're travelling with or it's curtains for humanity.
